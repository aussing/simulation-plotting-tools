# simulation-plotting-tools

A collection of my own tools for creating various plots used for my research. I mostly worked with Gadget-4 output HDF5 files, but there are also scripts to analyse Powderday dust files, Swift output files and different (sub)halo finders: FOF+subfind, AHF, and Velociraptor.
