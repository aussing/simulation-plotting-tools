# simulation-plotting-tools

A collection of my own tools for creating various plots used for my research. I mostly worked with Gadget-4 output HDF5 files, but there are also scripts to analyse Powderday dust files, Swift output files and different (sub)halo finders: FOF+subfind, AHF, and Velociraptor.

These scripts are in various stages of usability, especially given they're currently setup to analyse simulations according to my own naming conventions, and some haven't been used since early in my PhD (~2022). If you plan on using any I would check carefully to make sure the scripts actually do what you think they're doing.
